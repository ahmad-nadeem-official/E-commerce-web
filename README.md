# E-Commerce Website Project

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for an **E-Commerce Website** that I developed as part of a client project. The website allows users to browse products, add them to the shopping cart, and securely checkout. The client has approved the public release of most of the code, with certain sensitive parts—like payment processing, authentication, and backend logic—excluded for security reasons.

> **Important**: Sensitive features such as payment integration, authentication, and backend processes have been removed from this repository as per the client's request. The client has allowed the public release of the non-sensitive portions of the code only.

## Features
- **Product Catalog**: Users can browse a variety of products available for sale.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, view, and manage items in the cart.
- **Checkout System**: Allows users to complete their purchase (payment integration excluded).
- **Admin Panel**: For managing product listings and user orders.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and optimized for all devices.
